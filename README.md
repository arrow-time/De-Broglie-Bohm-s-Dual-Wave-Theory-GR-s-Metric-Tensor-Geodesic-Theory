# De Broglie-Bohm's Pilot-Wave Quantum Potential Dual-Wave Theory and Its Correspondence with General Relativity's Metric Tensor–Geodesic Theory

## Can the quantum potential in the De Broglie-Bohm theory be understood from the perspective of the metric tensor in general relativity as a pilot-wave potential? Both involve spatial geometric deformations inducing the propagation direction of matter wave packets?


My understanding is that matter is also a wave packet in space, so deformations of space itself would affect the propagation direction and speed of the wave packet? Matter waves are local wave packets of space itself.

And the pilot wave in De Broglie-Bohm theory essentially describes the metric tensor, i.e., the degree of deformation of space itself or the distribution of energy gradients. Matter waves are topologically stable wave packets of space itself, and the pilot wave guides the direction of matter wave propagation.

From the perspective that matter waves are topologically stable wave packets of space itself, the dual-wave mechanism of matter waves and pilot waves is actually the interaction between topologically stable wave packets (matter waves) in space and the deformation of space itself. This is logically isomorphic to the theory of metric tensor–geodesics in the equations of general relativity.

The quantum potential is non-local, while the metric is local. If understood this way: Bohm defines the spatial potential as the global spatial configuration. As an overall configuration, if there are global constraints, such as global energy conservation, it can naturally explain cross-local correlations without violating local causality.

From this perspective, both De Broglie-Bohm's matter wave–pilot wave quantum potential theory and general relativity can be understood as frameworks where matter is a topologically stable wave packet of space itself. The energy distribution and geometric configuration of space itself induce the motion state and trajectory of matter wave packets. They merely adopt the same conceptual framework, seeking to formalize it mathematically from the perspectives of quantum systems and macroscopic spatial geometry respectively.

When two distinct academic paths converge on the same framework, does it suggest that this framework is likely the correct direction?
