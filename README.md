# De-Broglie-Bohm-s-Dual-Wave-Theory-GR-s-Metric-Tensor-Geodesic-Theory
Can the quantum potential in the De Broglie-Bohm theory be understood from the perspective of the metric tensor in general relativity as a pilot-wave potential? Both involve spatial geometric deformations inducing the propagation direction of matter wave packets?
